                Of the notable engines that’s available to developers for free, there are two popular engines that garnered a large supportive community and are used by even large studios: Unity and Unreal. Both of these game engines are available to download for free but, after earning a certain amount of revenue, a certain percentage must be paid in return.
                <br />
                Budding game engines such as Godot Engine and Armory3D do not have the same drawback and are available completely free to use. The disadvantage to these less renown engines is that the engines may not be as feature rich and have a smaller community.
                <br />
                A good middle ground is Amazon’s Lumberyard. This game engine boast capabilities good enough for an AAA game, but remains completely free.
