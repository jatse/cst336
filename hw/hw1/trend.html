                Game engines are constantly updated to meet current trends and new technologies. Compared to the early 1990’s, when id Software created their iconic Doom engine, today’s hardware is more powerful; utilizing multiple processing cores, faster graphic rendering, and higher output resolutions. Form factors have also evolved, trending towards mobile devices and headsets for augmented and virtual reality. 
                <br />
                Formerly, games were a one-time purchase with perhaps an occasional expansion and only playable on the appropriate console. Games today can receive daily updates and offset processing to cloud servers, so networking APIs are crucial. Cross platform deployment is also crucial, as developers seek to increase their audience.
