                The market for video games have become more friendly for independent developers. Distribution platforms like Steam and mobile app stores has allowed indie games to proliferate globally without the need of a big name publisher. But the development process for making a game is still laborious, and being an independent developer often means making a game is more for personal satisfaction than profit. 
                <br />
                To leverage the lack of time, money, and human resources of a large game developing studio, there are many free and open-source resources that can help developers. Game engines are a software solution of code libraries, media manipulation features, and authoring tools that help expedite the game making process by reducing the amount of explicit code developers have to write.
